# Design Improvements

## Typography
I picked these typefaces, Abril Fatface and Open Sans, because they are suggested by Google as a good pair.


## Readability
I changed the line height of each section to be 1.8em in order to increase readability of the big blocks of text.

The content in the aside was too small and had poor readability, therefore the font-size in the aside was increased to 18px and the line height was increased to 1.3em.

## CRAP Principles

### Contrast
The original design had a good contrast because it uses mainly black and white.
However it used a single typeface for both headers and paragraphs. The headers have been changed to use Abril Fatface to increase contrast between headers and paragraphs.


### Repetition
The original design already had good repetition. Each section repeats with the same layout.

### Alignment
The position of the h1 of the last section was modified because it was out of alignment in respect to the other h1s.

### Proximity
The spacing between the different sections has been increased in order to further separate content about different students.
