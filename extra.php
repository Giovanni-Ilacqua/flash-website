			I work part time as a Technical Assistant at the University of Rochester School of Nursing, where I provide support in IT, Facilities, and Educational Media.  Workshop leading/TAing was also a source of income in the past, though I’ve let that go for my last semester of college.  Additionally, I am a Kearns Scholar and a Hajim Scholar, two academic distinctions I’m proud of.  Extracurricular-wise, I recently finished my term as the Public Relations Chair of WiC (Women in Computing), a club I was (and still am!) extremely dedicated to.  I’ve been fortunate to do so much in WiC, including alumni video interviews in conjunction with the Office of Admissions, merchandise production, a successful #SupportWomenInCS campaign, and a burgeoning PhD-Undergraduate Computer Science program!  Along with my work in WiC, I am a co-founder of 1st Gen Society, the home for the first-generation college students at UR.

			I worked at an equity research firm as a summer analyst in New York City this past summer, where I performed in-depth equity research on the industrials sector and created 10 company profiles including risk assessment and investment considerations. In addition, I built models to track historical trading performance of the 10 companies based on EV/EBITDA, P/E multiples, and conducted DCF analysis of shipping/logistics companies and projection of cash flows and calculation of WACC as well. Before that I interned at a wealth management firm in Hongkong in my sophomore summer. During my internship, I evaluated competitive landscape of the wealth management industry, focusing on the advantages of External Asset Managers (EAMs) compared to private banks and other securities firms. In addition, I contributed to the development of risk-return tradeoff recommendations and customized investment strategies for clients, with an average portfolio size exceeding HKD$50 million. In the end of my internship, I created a deck detailing tax implication of insurance and trust products which allowed clients to better plan for their investments in the context of wealth transfer and optimization of estate planning and inheritance tax.

		<p> This past year, I started rethinking my entire major when I fell in love with programming. As a senior, all I can do now is take any class I can fit in my schedule. I am currently auditing CSC 171. I am also working on some projects in Python to improve my programming skills. Likely, I have a professor helping me out, but this is going to be a very long semester because I am more than overloading.</p>
