		<h2>Hobbies</h2>

		<p>
			In my freetime, I enjoy reading novels, self-help books, and non-fiction books that shed light on very specific topics (e.g. rat population in New York City, processed food marketing history of the USA, growth of anti-Semitism on Twitter, etc).  I also enjoy cooking, especially Bangladeshi foods, since that’s my cultural background and what home food is for me.  In particular, I enjoy cooking for others (this is an invitation!).  I would consider myself a people person on most days, and I always enjoy meeting and getting to know new people.  In terms of non-computing languages, I am fluent in English and Bangla (westernized for Bengali).  A lifetime dream I recently completed was seeing Beyoncé live.  A remaining lifetime dream is to travel more.  Beyond that, a hobby I hope to redevelop is playing chess, while a habit I’d like to develop is going to the gym…

			I like to travel. I just went back from a study abroad program called Semester at Sea where we got chance to travel to 10 countries on a ship. We embarked in Germany, and visited Spain, Ghana, South Africa, Mauritius, India, Myanmar, Vietnam, China, Japan, Hawaii, and disembarked in San Diego. We took courses, related to each country’s history, politics, culture, and economics, on the ship from one port to next port. When we got to each port, we did independent travelling in different cities. We visited Barcelona and Valencia in Spain; Tema, Accra, and Cape Coast in Ghana; Cape Town in South Africa; Port Louis in Mauritius; Kochi, Bengaluru and Chennai in India; Yangon, Mandalay and Bagan in Myanmar; Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City), and Nha Trang in Vietnam; Shanghai, Hangzhou, Xi’an in China; Kobe, Osaka, and Kyoto in Japan; Honolulu in Hawaii. It was a three months travelling and the voyage did broaden my horizon and enrich my cross-cultural perspectives.

		<p> I am originally from Burundi, a tiny country shaped like a heart and located at the heart of Africa. I moved to the U.S to get a good education that would be useful to bring back home. Ultimately, I would like to start my own non-profit in Burundi, one that is focused on helping women and children pull themselves out of poverty. However, building a non-profit that is self-sustainable and that lasts turned out to be harder than it looked but I am not giving up.</p>
